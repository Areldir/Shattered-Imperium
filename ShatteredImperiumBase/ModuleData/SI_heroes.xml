Renowned across the Nahasa for his cunning and political mastery, he has spent many years ensuring the primacy of his house through a combination of diplomacy and commerce, monopolizing the caravan routes across the central Nahasa whilst fending off the interests of other emirs. However, many Aserai nobles grumble that Aydas is doing too little to advance the Aserai as a people, preferring to secure his own position than to take the leadership of his people. Indeed, there are some who openly declare that the Aserai would be better served by a singular ruler - a sultan, rather than mere emirs."/>

Many also blame his incessant warring for the continuing disunity of the Aserai Emirates, claiming there can be no peace among the emirs whilst he remains in power."/>

This policy has earned him great respect among the Battanian commonfolk, though the more warlike elements of Battanian society resent his reluctance for conflict, openly accusing him of cowardice. However, few can deny that Aetaric’s cautious approach has so-far paid off, with the coffers of the fen Derngil now overflowing from both clever investments and tribute from their raiding warbands, whilst the Battanian Kingdom has reclaimed much of their former territory from the crumbling Calradian Empire through subterfuge, rather than open war."/>

Following the death of her husband, the Calradian Senate was quick to make her regent for her son Jamanys, though this decision divided the Calradian nobility into bitterly rival factions. The first female ruler of the Calradian Empire since the lady Zeona, two centuries ago, Helenea will rule until her son comes of age. Generous and wise, she is a popular figure with the Calradian people, known for her lavish donations to the poorest citizens of the imperial cities and villages. However, she has little support amongst those in the senatorial nobility who remain loyal to her family. Whilst they voted for her son, many in the senate worry that Helenea may take the imperial throne for herself, instead of handing over power when Jamanys is at the rightful age."/>

A cunning politician and efficient administrator, he successfully led the Empire in campaigns of expansion to the east, incorporating much of the territory east of Lake Tanaesis into the imperial fold. However, his reign also saw the degradation of the western provinces, with the destruction of many ancient and storied cities and towns first by Battanian raiders, and later by the increasingly assertive and warlike Vlandians. Whilst many in the Calradian Senate believed that Themestios may have been able to turn the fortunes of the Calradian Empire around, his reign was cut short when a campaign into the Iltan Portages went awry, with the imperial camp being overrun by Byalic horsemen during the night. In the brief battle, Themestios was slain and the dragon banner of Calradios was carried off by Byalic warriors as a trophy. With his death, the last bonds holding imperial authority together were severed, and the Calradian Empire - relatively stable and peaceful for centuries - was quick to descend into civil war."/>

Arriving too late to save her father from the cruel axes of the Byalic warriors, Junaea nonetheless acquitted herself well in combat, rallying her father’s troops, pursuing and slaying many Byals as they withdrew victorious from the field. Despite being present for her father's death and responsible for the recovery of his body, Junaea was passed over for succession to the imperial throne in favor of her younger brother. Proud and adventurous, she now follows her own path, leading her troops in the hope of gaining glory on the battlefield."/>

After the untimely death of his father Themestios battling against the Byals in the east, the Calradian Senate met to vote on the matter of succession. The late-emperor had named his son as heir, though many senators believed that a boy so young was unfit to rule, and would only result in the loss of more land to the rising Vlandian Kingdom. A vote was held, with Jamanys being confirmed as the next emperor by an incredibly slim margin. Abandoned immediately by nearly half of the senate, who fled to the west, the remaining senators named Jamanys' mother Helenea regent until he comes of age. However, with civil war raging on all sides, some say the Empire may not survive long enough for him to take his throne."/>
	<Hero id="AR_lord_1_15" alive="false" faction="Faction.clan_empire_west_1" text="{=si_ar_lord_1_15_text}Zaricos reigned as the Emperor of the Calradian Empire from the years 895 to 934. His lifetime saw notable changes in the character of his empire and its people, as well as the expansion and contraction of imperial borders across the continent. In the south, Zaricos led his legions against the Aserai, extending the border from the walls of the colony of Yachios to Qasira on the coast of the Perassic Sea, whilst the rise of the Alkit and Vaegir realms in the north saw the loss of much of the Calradian frontier around Lake Laconis. However, possibly the most significant event to occur during Zaricos’ reign would occur in 913, when a massive earthquake practically levelled the ancient Calradian capital of Charasea. The city’s population, long made up primarily of Vlandian settlers, were quick to begin reconstruction. However, little of Charasea’s former splendour was left recognisable. Despite this, Zaricos’ reign is remembered as a time of stability for the majority of the Calradian Empire, whose citizens enjoyed great peace and prosperity. Zaricos died peacefully in his sleep, transferring the imperial crown to his son Themestios. He is remembered fondly across Calradia, with statues erected in his memory."/>

Whilst this caused a great deal of tension with his fellow senators, who frequently whispered that he was little more than a yes-man, Ulbos was rewarded for his loyalty when the young prince Themestios chose his daughter, Helenea, to be his wife. A prominent figure in Calradian politics for the rest of his days, Ulbos was killed after being thrown from his horse whilst hunting. He is remembered fondly by the people of the Calradian Empire as a fair ruler and generous benefactor."/>

	<Hero id="AR_lord_1_5" faction="Faction.clan_empire_north_3" text="{=si_ar_lord_1_5_text}Solarios 'Light-Giver' was born Zenon of the Neretzes family. A formidable warrior and general in his younger years, he quickly rose to lead the eastern legions of the Calradian Empire. Whilst not present at the battle that routed the imperial armies and killed Emperor Themestios Comnos, his decisive actions saw his own legions fall upon the victorious Byalics only a few weeks later, destroying their army and reclaiming the Dragon Banner of Calradios. Whilst he dutifully dispatched the banner back to the Calradian Senate, his troops saw his valor and leadership in battle, and so hailed him as emperor. This shattered the Calradian Empire, initiating the deadly civil war that now engulfs the continent. A failed assassination attempt by an unknown assailant left Zenon scarred and badly shaken. Taking solace in an obscure eastern religion, he began to believe that he was the mortal incarnation of the sun god himself, and so duly named himself Solarios 'Light-Giver'. Branded a heretic by the Calradian Senate, he has carved a bloody swathe through his enemies and friends alike, driving himself ever further into madness. Now, his remaining generals support him out of fear, though know that clever politics may just turn their emperor's insanity to their own advantage."/>

However, in an event now marked as a crime by both the Senate and people of the Calradian Empire, Apolytea was executed on her husband's insane orders after he observed her gazing at the moon out of their bedroom window one night and believed she was communicating with his mortal enemy - the moon god."/>

He was forced to watch as his mother was executed on his father's insane orders - a crime that many of his colleagues in the eastern legions find repulsive. Indeed, whispers abound in the eastern provinces of the Calradian Empire that Semnon plots to usurp his father and take the family back into the imperial fold, though it remains to be seen if such rumors bear fruit."/>

Whilst many among the Calradian nobility consider him to be a vain individual, lording his family's reputation over his peers, the people of Charasea see things differently. To the commonfolk, Eronys is a beacon, a symbolic protector of all that Charasea represents - its history, institutions, and customs. An unwilling participant in the civil war that has engulfed the Calradian Empire, he has made several appeals to the courts of both the Comnos and Neretzes families, knowing that only through a unity of purpose might imperial authority in the west of the continent now survive against the oncoming hordes of the Vlandians. However, should diplomacy fail, and war with his peers amongst the Calradian nobility become an inevitability, Eronys has prepared his people for conflict. Years of war against the fierce Battanian hillmen have left him a capable warrior, and there are few who would doubt his competence in leading his legions in battle."/>

A man whose intelligence and cunning is only matched by his cruelty, he has spent many years roaming the wastes of the east, killing or enslaving any who would dare to challenge the supremacy of his tribe. The prolonged, though rare, spirit of unity that has appeared amongst the usually disparate and warring tribes of the Devseg can be largely attributed to his iron will, casting aside the weaker tribes and welding those who have proven their strength into a singular force capable of challenging the Calradian and Darshi empires for control of the steppe. Despite his warlike manner, Tulag has not neglected his civil duties either, turning the spoils of battle and trade over to the purpose of enriching not only his nobles and warriors, but also the commonfolk accompanying his hordes. Indeed, it is not uncommon to see even the poorest members of an Iltanlar horde clad in more fine jewelery than the wealthiest of Calradian nobles - even if that jewelery is still stained in the blood of its previous owners. Such a reputation has made Tulag Khan a worthy figure for Calradians to both fear and respect."/>

Whilst her husband may ride out to crush his enemies in the field, it is BIlik who ensures domestic enemies remain placated, speaking at councils of the Iltanlar nobility and swaying the opinions of potential adversaries with carefully considered gifts and bribes."/>

Unlike most of his people, Khakhun has no superstitions about the other peoples of Calradia, surrounding himself with foreign mercenaries, priests and scholars. Such a move has no altruistic basis, however, as Khakhun has set his eyes on further conquest - to ride west and seize the rich lands and city states of the Darshi along the great Lake Tanaz. For this, he says, 'a man must understand all facets of the world, his rivals, and their weaknesses with which a man might defeat them'."/>

He, like many boyars before him, has had to carefully maintain the balance of power between the warring groups of Sturgians and Vakken that make up his realm. Cunning and ruthless in both warfare and diplomacy, he has managed to thus far keep his peers in line by tactical displays of force, destroying minor threats with absolute might so that the other Sturgians may both fear and respect him. A Nord by blood, Sivur is always sure to make the best of his heritage and the reputation of his people, contracting bands of Nordic raiders to do his bidding in exchange for lands and titles within his realm. Such a practice remains controversial with the other boyars, who view Nords as little more than foreign savages, however few would dare openly question the Gundaroving, lest they be met with the cold axes of the north-men. Ever vigilant for opportunities to expand his power, Sivur views the ongoing civil war in the Calradian Empire as a chance for his people to reclaim much of their lost lands, and to expand their reach into the lands of the Calradians and their vassalized Vakken servants."/>

'If a man wishes not to wield this,' he often says, brandishing his favourite axe, 'then he should be ruled over by one who shall!'

Taught to distrust imperial authority, Osric spent much of his youth rallying the disparate Vlandian noble families under his authority, besting in duels any who would not willingly submit. Word of his deeds spread like wildfire amongst the Vlandian people, and soon they would rise up in open rebellion against the Calradian Empire, seizing key locations throughout the west and causing the few remaining imperial citizens to flee before them. On the plains south of Paravenos, the imperial authorities would make their stand, sending two legions to fight against Osric and his rebels. As the battle raged around him, Osric confronted a member of the Calradian Vaegir Guard in single combat. The fight lasted for an hour, and though slashed across one eye by the guardsman's dagger, Osric managed to grapple the man to the ground, beating him to death and earning the title of 'Iron-Arm'.

A vain man, governed by a strict and elitist code of ethics, he has done much to grow the wealth and prestige of his family, buying the industrial and farming interests from displaced Calradians and replacing them with loyal Vlandians. Though undoubtedly prominent in the political circles of the nascent Vlandian Kingdom, Servic remains a largely disliked figure among his peers, his tardiness in joining the rebellion of Osric ‘Iron-Arm’, as well as his numerous contacts in the Calradian aristocracy, earning him the ire of his fellow barons."/>

A proven commander known for fighting at the head of his armies, he has led the Spahanfari to great victories over the Aserai Emirates and Calradian Empire, ensuring the protection of his foothold in the Nahasa. From his many palaces in the Darshi borderlands, he reigns over a vast realm of arid deserts, featureless steppe and craggy mountains, occupied by a myriad of peoples who speak in a myriad of tongues. For nearly two centuries, his house has carried the banner of the Padishah proudly forward, even coming to rival the Calradian Empire itself on more than one occasion. Now, with that empire descending into civil war, and the thunder of hooves echoing across the desert and steppe, heralding the arrival of new foes, Nariman finds himself in a position unlike any of his ancestors, facing threats to his realm from all sides. Though he recognizes the authority of the Padishah, he knows that to maintain his own power, he must be every bit a sovereign in his own right, and so frequently holds court with his nobles and sends envoys to the peoples of Calradia to dictate the Padishah's terms, and of course, his own."/>

An acclaimed commander in battle, he has led his father's warriors in many campaigns against the nomads of the Nahasa and Devseg, winning glories for his people and realm unseen since the days of the Padishah Hoshtar. Unlike his father, who would wish to maintain the borders of the Spahanfar Satrapy during these uncertain times, Wasur views the Calradian civil war as a great chance to expand his realm into new territories. His cavalry - known as the 'Gilded Ones' for their shining armor - strike fear into the Aserai and Iltanlar alike, and few would stand in the way of his ambitions."/>

However, Lazur, like his father and grandfather before him, has not sat idly and accepted the fate of his house, turning his reputation to gain monopolies over trade in and out of the western imperial borderlands. He now rivals the Shah of the Spahanfari in wealth and power, and remains ever vigilant for new avenues to expand his influence and standing in the realm."/>
