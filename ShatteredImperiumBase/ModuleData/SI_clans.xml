			 text="{=si_ar_clan_aserai_6_text}The Banu Atij are without peer in the vast and dusty lands to the south of Calradia that comprise the Nahasa Desert. Unlike many of their kin among the Aserai, they were quick to realize the value of using their nomadic warriors to protect - rather than raid - the merchant caravans crossing the great bronze desert. From their seat of power at the ancient oasis city of Qasira, the caravans of the Banu Atij range far and wide across the continent, bringing vast wealth through the trade of dates, silks and spices. This wealth has brought them great status among the Aserai, and there are few emirs who would deny the summons of the Banu Atij to matters of politics or war."

Few who travel to their fortress home of Hubyar return with tales of their hospitality, nor of their charm. However, somehow the Banu Qild have always retained a position of primacy in the politics of the great bronze desert, with more than one ancient Aserai family being ensnared by their cunning. Indeed, there are whispers that they long for days that they might lord over the other families of the Nahasa, uniting the disparate emirates into a single realm, with a Banu Qild at its head."

Instead, they lay claim to a lineage of the finest warriors of the great bronze desert, serving as the vanguard of many an emir’s host. In the years before the tribes of the Aserai settled in great towns along the coast of the Bahr al-Yeshm and around the oases of Calradia’s south, the Banu Arbas were feared as the scourge of any caravans who dared to enter their territory, raiding from the Jabal Ashabi Mountains in the east, to the Jabal Tamar Mountains in the west. Now settled in the lush lands along the Damar River, they have lost none of their potency on the field of battle, and few would dare to face them in the desolate, sandy dunes of their homeland."

This transition was not without bloodshed however. In the past century, the Banu Sarran fought a series of brutal conflicts with the neighboring Banu Hulyan Emirate, attempting to seize lands off the latter to form their own realm. Ultimately unsuccessful in this, they are widely shunned by the other Aserai emirates as upstarts and violent usurpers, though this is a reputation which they in fact relish. They celebrate their nomadic past in odes and poems on their success in battle over fellow Aserai, or in seducing the other tribes' daughters. This does not endear them to the other peoples of the Nahasa, though they do maintain close ties with the Jawwal - that clan of outcasts who still live the nomadic lifestyle."

Trading perfumed silks and shaded pleasure gardens for feasting halls adorned with the skins and mounted heads of exotic beasts, the Banu Maluf are often seen associating more with the Bedouin of the Nahasa, than their peers among the Aserai emirs.

This position has brought the Banu Hulyan immense wealth, though their hunger for wealth and power is never sated. In recent years, their court has become home to an assortment of shamans and prophets, through which the Banu Hulyan hope to win the hearts and minds of the superstitious Aserai.

In centuries past, the expanding Darshi Empire conquered the eastern lands of the great bronze desert, coming to rule over a number of nomadic tribes in the process. The Banu Karama were one such people, swearing fealty to the Padishah in exchange for lands, titles and wealth.

Much like the Jokbyalics, the Kurtogulit have in more recent times become victims of the westward expansion of the Nachaghan tribe, being forced to migrate from their ancestral homeland downriver to the Iltan Portages. Gaining a hard lesson in warfare, they now serve as border guards of the Khanate, protecting the Iltan Portages from both east and west."

	Derthert - Cunning but weary king, Hugh Capet, trying to retain compassion
	Derthert, of the House of Meroc, is King of the Vlandians. His subjects regard him as a decent man but a tired one. He is worn down by years of struggle against vassals who swear oaths of fealty only to break them, who see no patch of pasture so worthless, no dynastic claim so unconvincingly traced, that they will not go to war over it. His heir, Alary, retains some of the optimism and vigor of youth, and it's widely believed that he will make a popular king. The  House of Meroc thinks of commoners as a counterbalance to the nobles, and have tried to elevate them to offices of authority when possible.

	<!--Vlandian warships first came to the western shores of Calradia as traders. Then, seeing how rich the land was, they decided to take it. First the Empire fought them, then when that failed granted them noble titles and estates to make them into imperial clients, and then - when they rebelled - fought them again. Now they are an independent kingdom, known for steel-forging and their horses, and their armored riders are a constant menace to the Empire's western marches.-->

	Ingalther, lord of the House of Cortain, seized his estate from a much older illegitimate half-brother. His ambition and sense of entitlement is extreme even by Vlandian standards. He has a dynastic claim to Arromanc lands, and has been pressing Derther to disinherit Calatild and award her lands to him. Derthert has of course refused, as this would both start a war with the Arromancs and make Ingalther twice as powerful as the king, but Ingalther nonetheless greatly resents him for it. Ingalther keeps close ties with the Free Company, a notoriously rapacious band of mercenaries whose seaside castle lies near his domains.

It fought with distinction for centuries, crushing all foes under foot. However, in the year 934 the nineth was marched into the Battanian highlands, never to return. Rumours spread that the legion was cut down by a horde of Battanian hillmen - its officers massacred and standards burned. Those few who survived took to the hills, becoming known as the Lost Legion. Whilst still bearing the arms and armor of a proud imperial legion, these men now fight for none but themselves, carving a bloody swathe across Calradia.">

Also, because the plots are hard to measure and tax, it's a very good strategy for people who don't care to be governed. Indeed, the Vanni are the remnant of the old Vakken people.
