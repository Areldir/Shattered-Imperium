Centuries ago, the Padishah of the Darshi led an army into the Nahasa from the east, conquering the Aserai clans along the fringe of the desert. In doing so, he brought Darshi culture and laws to the Nahasa, which many Aserai clans adopted. Soon, the Padishah retreated again, and the Aserai have since formed a loose union under the rule of the head of the Banu Atij, taking Darshi titles of Shah and Banbishn. The Calradian Empire has ensured the instability of the region by pitting the clans of the Banu Asera against each other, forcing the weak out into the desert to raise goats and raid caravans. However, change is once again afoot, and a prophet from a distant oasis whispers in the court of the Banu Hulyan of treachery and a new way in which the clans of the Aserai may be united.">

Over time, the Calradians relentlessly expanded their territories across the continent, founding new colonies and conquering neighbouring peoples until soon, their empire stretched from the Western Ocean to the Great Grass Sea. Cunning politics ensured new peoples and cultures were assimilated into the Empire, whilst the might of the legions ensured the stability of the borders. However, recently cracks have started to form in the very heart of the Calradian Empire, pitting brother against brother in a series of devastating civil wars. Smelling weakness, barbarians now make frequent incursions into the Empire's borders to raid, or worse, to carve out their own kingdoms. Despite this, to many in the Empire's heartland, life continues much as it always has. Farmers still toil under a blazing sun, the senate still meets to debate matters of state, and the vaunted imperial legions have lost none of their potency, carrying the Dragon Banner of Calradios forward to victory.">

Halted when they reached the shores of Lake Tanaesis, they drained marshes and turned the river floodplains into wheatfields, cut back forests and turned the hillsides into pasture. The generals of the east; proud sons of the Empire's noble families, are uniquely bloodthirsty amongst their fellows. Three years ago, after a victory over the Jokbyalics that restored the fortunes of the Calradians, the pre-eminent general Zenon of the Neretzes clan was hailed Emperor by his troops, splitting the Calradian Empire and igniting civil war. Zenon, now styling himself Solarios 'Light-Giver', has forged the eastern provinces into a powerful empire, driving the armies of friend and foe alike before his battle-hardened legions.">

However, now the Empire's western provinces are in crisis. The former capital city of Paravenos has fallen to the Vlandians - one-time auxiliaries in the Empire's legions. Facing an existential threat to their ancestral lands and way of life, the senators of the western provinces voted for secession from the Empire, electing the Praetor of Charasea to lead them in plunging the Empire further into civil war.">

However, despite their shared ancestry, the Sturgians refuse to unify, even refusing to use the term 'king'. Instead, the petty princes of Sturgia occasionally come together to follow the strongest prince during times of crisis. In recent decades, the leader of the powerful Gundaroving principality has sought to increase their power over the other princes, forcing the adoption of Nordic names and titles, and the formation of a centralized authority. Now, the Sturgian principalities look outwards, seeking to conquer lands to the east and south, and to unify the entire north under their rule.">

However, realizing the fragile nature of Calradian rule in the north, the emperors instead chose to form a puppet state, electing a High Boyar to oversee a small senate comprising the elders of the Vakken tribes. Since then, the Boyars of Vaegiria have expanded their realm to the east, seizing the territories of both the Iltanlar and other Vakken alike. They still remain loyal to the emperors; at least notionally, though the free spirit of the Vakken people still survives, waiting for the day they once more may be the rulers of their own destinies.">

	         text="{=AR_kingdom_quyaz_text}The Kannic colonies of Quyaz once held a vast empire on the southern coasts of the Perassic Sea. Centuries ago, they fought a series of bloody wars against the Calradian Republic, eventually losing and being incorporated into the growing empire. Over the years, the Quyazics have been thoroughly Calradicized, losing much of their culture and language, though have retained a largely autonomous political system, even maintaining an elected senate to manage provincial affairs. During recent years, increasing raids on the Nahasan borders stretched Calradian garrisons to breaking point, resulting in a number of border forts being overrun. Ineffective imperial administration ignored the pleas of the Quyazics to protect them, and so the province soon looked to its own protection, raising legions and electing generals from among the Quyazic nobility. Ten years ago, a Quyazic general seized the opportunity and declared independence, founding the Quyazic Empire. However, not long after his ascendence he was found in his chambers with a knife embedded in his back, and so the crown was passed by will to his daughter's line. Under their young empress, the Quyazics now look outwards for conquest.">

	         text="{=si_ar_kingdom_alkit_text}The past century of Calradian history has seen the rise of many short-lived kingdoms, each attempting to gain land and power from the instability of the Calradian Empire. The Alkit Khanate is one such state. Two generations ago, the Calradian Emperor Zaricos Comnos hired tribes of the Iltanlar to retake the colony of Varnapolys from Nordic invaders. The Alkits eagerly accepted the imperial contract, drawing on the wanderlust of other nomadic tribes to form a vast host and soon defeating the outnumbered Nords. Rewarded with stewardship of Varnapolys in the Empire's name, the Alkit found themselves among the most powerful peoples on the continent. However, the steppe breeds an unquenchable restlessness, and so the Alkit soon betrayed the Empire, cutting a swathe of conquest through the divided Sturgian and Vakken realms to form their own realm from the ashes. Now, the Alkit Khanate is on the defensive, unable to gain support from the other Iltanlar clans of their homeland far to the east, and so must fight for survival of their new realm.{newline}{newline}History:{newline}{newline}">

Viewed by the Empire as traitors, and their Vlandian cousins as brutal barbarians, the Massan tribes now consolidate for themselves a small kingdom in the Ebor Peninsula.">

Now, with the Aserai growing increasingly assertive and seeking to create a realm of their own, the Spahanfar shah and their warlords find themselves on the defensive, fighting to maintain their hold over the great bronze desert.">

Traditionally a militarily poor people, over the centuries, emperors and padishahs have exacted tribute from the Tanashi in return for assuring their sovereignty, though all that has changed in recent years. Six decades ago, a Calradian general marched his army across the Iltan Portages and subjugated the Tanash city states in a swift campaign, forming the imperial protectorate of Transtanaesia. Though they have resisted all attempts at calradicization, they now see the impending Calradian civil war as an opportunity to regain their total independence.">

A hardy people descended from the intermarrying of Byals – distant relatives of the Vakken - with Nordic colonists from the north, for centuries they dwelled in small, isolated villages, carving out a meagre existence raising cattle in sheltered grasslands between the Karakaz River and northern forests, and fishing the frigid waters of the Byalic Sea. However, matters would change in the year 945, when the Nachaghan tribe from the east thundered into the Jokbyalic territory, pillaging the land and enslaving its people. Whilst the Jokbyals mounted a stalwart defense, the sheer numbers of the nomads would prove too much. Threatened with annihilation, the Jokbyals migrated west, carving a desperate, bloody swathe across the Iltan Portages into the Calradian Empire. They would earn infamy in routing the imperial armies, killing the Emperor Themestios and causing the civil war that has brought the Calradian Empire to its knees. They now find themselves with a small kingdom in the Calradian borderlands, far from their home, with bitter enemies on all sides. It remains to be seen how long the Jokbyals may hold out against such seemingly impossible odds.">
