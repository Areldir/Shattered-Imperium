Halted when they reached the shores of Lake Tanaesis, they drained marshes and turned the river floodplains into wheatfields, cut back forests and turned the hillsides into pasture. The generals of the east; proud sons of the Empire's noble families, are uniquely bloodthirsty amongst their fellows. Three years ago, after a victory over the Gotarnians, the pre-eminent general Zenon of the Neretzes clan was hailed Emperor by his troops, splitting the Calradian Empire and igniting civil war. Zenon, now calling himself Solarios 'Light-Giver', channels his ever-growing insanity into ruling the east with an iron fist, driving the armies of friend and foe alike before his battle-hardened legions.">

According to legend, Calradios the Great first landed at the site of the present-day city of Charasea, laying the foundation of an empire which would last through the ages. However, now the Empire's western provinces are in crisis. The former capital city of Baravenos has fallen to the Vlandians; one-time auxiliaries in the Empire's legions. Facing an existential threat to their ancestral lands and way of life, the senators of the western provinces voted for secession from the Empire, electing the Praetor of Charasea to be Emperor and plunging the Empire into civil war.">

Over time, the Calradians relentlessly expanded their territories across the continent, founding new colonies and conquering neighbouring peoples until soon, their empire stretched from the Western Ocean to the Great Grass Sea. Cunning politics ensured new peoples and cultures were assimilated into the Empire, whilst the might of the legions ensured the stability of the borders. However, recently cracks have started to form in the very heart of the Calradian Empire, pitting brother against brother in a series of devastating civil wars. Smelling weakness, barbarians now make frequent incursions into the Empire's borders to raid, or worse, to carve out their own kingdoms. Despite this, to many in the Empire's heartland, life continues much as it always has. Farmers still toil under a blazing sun, the senate still meets to debate matters of state, and the vaunted imperial legions have lost none of their potency, carrying the Dragon Banner of Calradios forward to victory.">

As boomtowns sprung up alongside the bays and lakes of the north, the local tribal leaders forged marriage pacts with Nords and other adventurers, trading amber and furs for their swords to subdue neighbouring Sturgian principalities or Vakken tribes. However, despite their shared ancestry, the Sturgians refuse to unify, even refusing to use the term 'king'. Instead, the petty princes of Sturgia occasionally come together to follow the strongest prince during times of crisis. In recent decades, the leader of the powerful Gundaroving principality has sought to increase their power over the other princes, forcing the adoption of Nordic names and titles, and the formation of a centralized authority. Now, the Sturgian principalities look outwards, seeking to conquer lands to the east and south, and to unify the entire north under their rule.">

In doing so, he brought Darshi culture and laws to the Nahasa, which many Aserai clans adopted. Soon, the Padishah retreated again, and the Aserai have since formed a loose union under the rule of the head of the Banu Atij, taking Darshi titles of Shah and Banbishn. The Calradian Empire has ensured the instability of the region by pitting the clans of the Banu Asera against each other, forcing the weak out into the desert to raise goats and raid caravans. However, change is once again afoot, and a prophet from a distant oasis whispers in the court of the Banu Hulyan of treachery and a new way in which the clans of the Aserai may be united.">

However, realizing the fragile nature of Calradian rule in the north, the emperors instead chose to form a puppet state, electing a High Boyar to oversee a small senate comprising the elders of the Vakken tribes. Since then, the Boyars of Vaegiria have expanded their realm to the east, seizing the territories of both the Iltanlar and other Vakken alike. They still remain loyal to the emperors; at least notionally, though the free spirit of the Vakken people still survives, waiting for the day they once more may be the rulers of their own destinies.">

Centuries ago, they fought a series of bloody wars against the Calradian Republic, eventually losing and being incorporated into the growing empire. Over the years, the Quyazics have been thoroughly Calradicized, losing much of their culture and language, though have retained a largely autonomous political system, even maintaining an elected senate to manage provincial affairs. During recent years, increasing raids on the Nahasan borders stretched Calradian garrisons to breaking point, resulting in a number of border forts being overrun. Ineffective imperial administration ignored the pleas of the Quyazics to protect them, and so the province soon looked to its own protection, raising legions and electing generals from among the Quyazic nobility. Ten years ago, a Quyazic general seized the opportunity and declared independence, founding the Quyazic Empire. However, not long after his ascendence he was found in his chambers with a knife embedded in his back, and so the crown was passed by will to his daughter's line. Under their young empress, the Quyazics now look outwards for conquest.">

Viewed by the Empire as traitors, and their Vlandian cousins as brutal barbarians, the Massan tribes now consolidate for themselves a small kingdom in the Ebor Peninsula.">

In return, the Padishah granted the Spahadi shahs rule over the eastern Nahasa, founding great cities sheltered from the shifting sands by high walls. Now, with the Aserai growing increasingly assertive and seeking to create a realm of their own, the Spahadi shahs find themselves on the defensive, fighting to maintain their hold over the great bronze desert.">

Time and the inexorable march of the Calradian Empire's legions have been cruel to these people, extinguishing many old and famous states and assimilating others. A hardy warrior society, descended from the intermarrying of countless generations of Myzean with migrating Laconians and Vakken tribesmen, the Gotarnians resisted Imperial authority, maintaining their old traditions and stockpiling weapons for their eventual liberation. Two generations ago, they rose up against the Empire, conquering a vast territory across the Iltan Portages to the Darshi trade cities beyond Lake Tanaesis; 'Tanash' to the Darshi, hoping the high walls of these eastern territories would be safe from the Empire's grip. However, with whispers from the east of a great cataclysm, heralded by the thunder of hooves, the Gotarnians now find themselves facing threats from all sides.">
